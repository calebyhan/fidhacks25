## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from the Women in Tech panel on the first day of Fidhacks 2025. The Women in Tech Panel truly inspired us to reflect on a critical issue: the lack of confidence and support women often face when navigating their careers and ambitions. The panel opened our eyes to how deeply rooted self-doubt can be, especially in environments that seem intimidating. 

We asked ourselves: _What would it look like if encouragement was built into our everyday digital experiences?_

That’s when we decided to create **Kudos** 
Kudos is a space that flips the switch on social media by embracing positivity, not comparison.

## What it does
Kudos is a website built to help young women find their cheerleaders who will support them throughout their journey. After creating an account, users have the option to join made spaces from other users, as well as create their own space. Inside these spaces, users create posts, in which other users give "kudos" via a like button. The intention is that these posts are points in the journey towards a long-term goal. Additionally, we have a resources page that can be used to help boost confidence and provide further support to our users.

Kudos is a cloud-themed social platform designed to help young women find others who will support them throughout their journey. It is like your personal team of cheerleaders at your fingertips. 
- You start by creating an account
- Enter your cloud space
- Inside your space, you can see which clouds (support groups) you're part of.
- You can join or create clouds whether they're private for your close friends or public for general encouragement. 
- In these clouds, you can post your thoughts, ideas, hesitations, or goals and get real-time support from your chosen community. Users can give “kudos” via a like button. 

The intention is that these posts are points in the journey towards a long-term goal. Additionally, we have a resources page that can be used to help boost confidence and provide further support to our users.

Whether you are thinking about applying for a new job, thinking about trying a new hobby, or just trying to believe in yourself again—Kudos is designed to help you **bet on yourself**.

## How we built it
We began sorting out all our ideas on a whiteboard. Once we had a clear vision, we broke it down by making a design in Figma, then building the framework for the website, focusing on group interactions and a simple demo that gets our idea across. The front end was built using React, and we used Firebase Realtime Database for our database.

## Challenges we ran into
We all had different skill levels and had big ideas that had to be refined due to the time restraint. We had to prioritize what we needed and leave the rest for the future. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned a new framework in a night and an entirely new database. 
Deployed our prototype and developed a refined idea on how to improve women's experience in the workforce. 

## What we learned
Learning the importance of prioritizing tasks.

## What's next for Kudos
Our plans for Kudos are to expand our user base, implement an improved and seamless UI, and add more tools within the website. These tools include more profile customization, more reactions towards posts, and monitored replies to the posts. We also wish to integrate Firebase Storage to implement profile pictures and general user media uploads.
